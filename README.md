# Anemia-Detect-Pro
AnemiaDetect Pro is a machine learning application that predicts anemia by analyzing a single, non-invasive image. It uses a dual-path system with dedicated models to process either a patient's eye conjunctiva or fingernail. After the prediction, a large language model (LLM) provides a clear and personalized explanation of the results.
